<h2>Podcast Recommedation App</h2>
<h3>User Interview Summary</h3>
<p>
The service I chose to focus on was Apple's Podcasts App, which, while very useful, can be a bit
overwhelming to discover new content.</p>
<p>
I structured my interview questions to explore the interviewee's familiarity with podcast type media, their usage habits, how, where and when they consume this content and any insights I could glean based on their responses.
</p>
I asked a variation on the following questions.
<ol>
<li>Do you listen to podcasts?</li>
<li>Why or why not?</li>
<li>Have you in the past?</li>
<li>Why did you stop?</li>
<li>What do you use to listen to them? How do you listen to them?</li>
<li>What do you like about that product?</li>
<li>What could be improved?</li>
<li>How often do you listen to podcasts?</li>
<li>How long are regular podcasts you listen too?</li>
<li>When and where do you listen to them?</li>
<li>How do you find Podcasts to listen and discover content? </li>
<li>What topics do they usually cover?v
 <li>Do you follow any particular channels, performers, websites?</li>
<li>Do you download them?</li>
</ol>
<p>

Podcasts popularity as a media channel has grown exponentially since the first podcast premier in 2003, with over Â 1 billion podcasts subscriptions on Apple's Itunes,  and one in four Americans ages 12-54 having had listened to a podcast in the last month and Monthly podcast listenership up over 75% since 2013. 
</p>
<p>
Contributing factors for this growth are:
- accessibility, with preinstalled podcast software and dedicated 
podcast channels on music services like Spotify
- bandwidth availability 
- mobile's increased prominence as the "first Screen.

<p>
During my interviews, I identified three types of listeners or nonlisteners. 
The "uninitiated," who either had decided they weren't interested in podcasts or had not gotten around to 
exploring them, despite some curiosity.
The casual listener who listens to one or two podcasts weekly and the ardent listener who has designated times and environments when they listen.
</p>
<p>
The listeners I spoke with relied heavily on friend recommendations to discover new content or else sought out well-known producers like NPR, TedTalks, Joel Osteen.  They also all had very specific content preferences, for example only listening to religious leaders, or science/technology talks. I also noticed all the podcast listeners I spoke with conveyed a preference for learning and informational type talks rather than entertainment based topics.
</p>
<p>
Everyone also identified habits around when-and-how.. The typical situation being when they can add it to another activity, like traveling, during their commute, as they are cleaning their house, exercising, etc. Most relied on their mobile devices for delivery.
</p>
<p>
What occurs to me is that as more of this type content is produced and becomes more readily accessible, for example, digital audio systems integrated into cars/planes, etc. Producers will look for ways to promote their offerings, and users will look to a trusted, agnostic source to help narrow down their options by topic, podcast length, social validation, 
producer, etc.
</p>
<p>
A recommendation platform that can help users filter down choices, even deliver daily recommendations via their mobile phone could be indispensable.
